# Morphological_Transformations-

Morphological transformations are a set of operations that process images based on their shapes. These operations apply a structuring element to an input image, creating an output image of the same size. They are primarily used in image processing for tasks such as noise removal, image enhancement, and object extraction. Common morphological operations include dilation, erosion, opening, and closing. These techniques are fundamental in the field of computer vision and are widely used in various applications, including medical imaging, character recognition, and automated inspection systems.

## Example Schema

Below is an example schema illustrating the basic morphological operations:

- **Dilation**: Adds pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image.
- **Erosion**: Removes pixels on object boundaries.
- **Opening**: Erosion followed by dilation, useful for removing small objects.
- **Closing**: Dilation followed by erosion, useful for closing small holes.

This schema helps visualize how each operation modifies the input image.
